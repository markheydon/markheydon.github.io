## Overview
**The Teachings of Monkey** is a playful, AI‑assisted archive that curates wisdom, humour, and narrative highlights from the classic *Monkey* TV series. The project distills episodes into accessible Markdown pages, weaving together character arcs, villain archetypes, and memorable teachings. It’s designed as both a nostalgic resource and a collaborative open‑source experiment in digital storytelling.

## Technologies Used
- **Hugo** — static site generator providing fast builds and flexible content structuring.
- **PaperMod theme** — clean, modern Hugo theme with pagination, search, and responsive layouts.
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting and deployment pipeline for the live site.
- **GitHub Actions** — automated builds and continuous deployment.
- **Markdown** — reproducible, admin‑light content format for episodes and extras.
- **AI‑assisted generation** — batch creation of episode pages, prompts for cross‑referencing, and playful branding elements.

## Key Features
- **Complete episode archive** — all 52 episodes documented with consistent formatting.
- **Curated extras** — Demon Hall of Fame, Pigsy’s Greatest Hits, Journey Tracker, and Monkey Teachings.
- **Playful branding** — “Irrepressible since 2025” footer, lyric fragments, and About page narrative flow.
- **Open source collaboration** — contributors can extend or remix content via GitHub.
