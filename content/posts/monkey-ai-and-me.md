## **A Blast from the Past**

Prompted by the recent addition of *Monkey* on Pluto TV (sometime around late 2025), I was reminded just how utterly awesome I thought the show was as an 80s kid. Of course, the chances of me having much of a clue what was actually going on at the tender age of 8 or 9 were next to zero. But like most kids at the time, the colours, the fighting, and the general madness drew me in. And clearly, as here I am some 40-odd years later still talking about it, in I stayed!

## **Hidden Wisdom in the Chaos**

What struck me this time around is that underneath all the camp, chaotic nonsense, there’s actually some genuinely enlightened stuff in there. Wouldn’t it be great if somewhere out there, people were following the teachings of *Monkey* as they go about their daily lives? (Monkey the show, not Monkey himself—though to be fair, he does drop the occasional nugget of wisdom.)

## **The Birth of a Weekend Project**

So, just like The Stone Monkey born from an egg on a mountain top, a weekend project was born: **The Teachings of Monkey Website**. And just like Monkey, the nature of it might just be irrepressible!
